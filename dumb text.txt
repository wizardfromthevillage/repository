Programming is the process of creating computer programs. Programs are written in languages like Python, Java, or C++. Each program solves a specific task: from simple number addition to robot control. To search information in text, algorithms like "substring search" are often used. For example, to find the word "code" in a document, the program checks each line and returns match positions. Text can be stored in .txt, .csv, or other formats. Notepad is a simple editor, but IDEs like PyCharm and VSCode are better for coding. When testing a program, check edge cases: empty text, long lines, special characters (@, #, 123). Regular expressions (regex) expand search capabilities. A quadcopter is controlled by code from a remote or autonomously. Text libraries in Python: re, string. Algorithm complexity is measured in Big O: linear O(n), quadratic O(nÂ²). Bug localization is part of development. Example text with numbers: 42, 3.14, 100500. UTF-8 encodes Unicode. The split() function splits strings by spaces. Graphs are plotted via matplotlib. AI analyzes data. Web scraping parses HTML. APIs send JSON requests. Encryption protects data. Git tracks changes. Docker containerizes apps. For/while loops handle repetition. Recursion needs caution. Cloud services (AWS, Azure) store data. Arrays/lists are basic structures. SQL queries databases. pytest tests logic. Virtual environments isolate dependencies.
